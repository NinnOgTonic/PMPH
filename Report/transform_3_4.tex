\section{Transformation 3 $\rightarrow$ 4: Parallelizing the outer loop}

In this change did not reduce the amount of work to be done or how it
was done. Rather, it made all the kernels run fewer time, but with a
larger grid. This is an improvement, both because the GPU scheduler
in general works better if it gets more work.

Especially some of the tridag-scans work a lot better than before,
because they had so few threads before.

This change caused a factor 5.2 speedup compared to the previous version
(from about 40 seconds to 7.8 seconds).

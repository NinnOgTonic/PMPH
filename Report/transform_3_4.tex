\section{Transformation 3 $\rightarrow$ 4: Parallelizing the outer loop}

In this change did not reduce the amount of work to be done or how it
was done. Rather, we reduced the number of times each kernel was run, but made them run with a
larger grid. This is an improvement, because the GPU scheduler
in general works better if it gets more work.

Especially some of the tridag-scans work a lot better than before,
because they had very few threads.

This change caused a factor 5.2 speed-up compared to the previous version
(from about 40 seconds to 7.8 seconds).

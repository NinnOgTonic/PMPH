\section{Transformation 1 $\rightarrow$ 2: OpenMP privatization}

The transformations done in our OpenMP version are very small: We
moved the calculation of \texttt{PrivGlobs} and \texttt{strike} into
the \texttt{value}-function. This caused the outer loop to be
parallelizable, so we put a pragma on it.

This caused a X times speedup. We did manage to squeeze slightly more
performance out of the code, by e.g. using arrays instead of
vectors. However the performance gains were quite small and the
changes quite large (and uninteresting), so we decided not to include
the further optimized version.

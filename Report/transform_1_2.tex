\section{Transformation 1 $\rightarrow$ 2: OpenMP privatization}

The transformations done in our OpenMP version are very small: We
moved the calculation of \texttt{PrivGlobs} and \texttt{strike} into
the \texttt{value}-function. This caused the outer loop to be
parallelizable, so we put a pragma on it for OpenMP parallelism.

This caused a ~19 times speedup (from 194.1 seconds to 10.3 seconds).
We did manage to squeeze slightly more performance out of the code,
e.g. by using arrays instead of vectors. However the performance gains
were quite small and the changes quite large (and uninteresting for this
version), so we decided not to include the further optimized version.

\section{Transformation 1 $\rightarrow$ 3: Na√Øve CUDA}

The purpose of this transformation was to take the original code and
make a parallel version of it without doing much work in terms of code
transformations. We simply took all loops that were trivially
parallizable and created kernels for them.

To make this work without being utterly slow, we also inlined tridag
and unpacked it into a few maps and three scans. The three scans in
each tridag were implemented as 2 kernels.

This change caused a factor 4.6 speedup compared to the previous version
(from around 187.8 seconds to 40 seconds).
